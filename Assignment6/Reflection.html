<pre><code>Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t present anything but I also did not miss any of 26 presentations. 
I want to say that all presentations were very interesting and I learned a lot from few of 
them and something from the others.

It  was very helpful to see how people prepare their presentations. Also it was very
informative for me to see different structures and organizations of students thoughts. 
Because now based on those presentations I can easily create my own very comparative 
presentation. 

First of all I would choose an extremely interesting topic because I need to get a full
attention from the class. Also I would try to speak really clear and loud because some
students are not native speakers. I would try to organize my presentation very neatly
because I saw some unorganized ones and it was horrible you can easily get lost and
forget what you were talking about. I would include a lot of slides with few main points
without overloading it with essays. Maybe I would choose one interesting and funny video
To make my presentation more friendly. Also I would add a lot of examples and
explanations. And the most import part is to be interactive with the class because
sometimes people can lost your thought and lost the interest to your presentation.

Overall, I am very glad that I was able to come in on every lecture and watch people 
presenting. I got a lot of examples of how to present in the proper way. And also I wrote
a feedback to every presenter it helps to summarize their presentations and find the 
strongest and the most weakest part of their presentations.</code></pre>
